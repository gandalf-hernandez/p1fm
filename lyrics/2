Sexy Back, by Justin Timberlake
I'm bringin' sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special what's behind your back
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
(Take ‘em to the bridge!)

Dirty babe
You see these shackles? Baby, I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
(Take ‘em to the chorus!)

Come here girl
(Go ‘head be gone with it)
Come to the back
(Go ‘head be gone with it)
VIP!
(Go ‘head be gone with it)
Drinks on me
(Go ‘head be gone with it)

Let me see what ya twerkin' with
(Go ‘head be gone with it)
Look at those hips
(Go ‘head be gone with it)
You make me smile
(Go ‘head be gone with it)
Come here child
(Go ‘head be gone with it)

Get your sexy on
(Go ‘head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on
(Go ‘head be gone with it)

Get your sexy on
(Go ‘head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on

I'm bringin' sexy back
Them motherfuckers don't know how to act
Girl let me make up for the things you lack
‘Cause you're burnin' up, I gotta get it fast
(Take ‘em to the bridge!)

You motherfuckers watch how I attack
If that's your girl, better watch your back
‘Cause she'll burn it up for me and that's a fact
