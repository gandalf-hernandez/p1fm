Usher Scream
Usher baby
yeah did it again
and this time I'm gonna make you scream,Usher
yeah man
.I see you over there so hypnotic,
Thinkin' 'bout what I'd do to that body,
I'll getchu like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Got no drink in my hand, but I'm wasted
Gettin' drunk off the thought of you naked
I'll getchu like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
And I've tried to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back
Chorus
If you wanna scream yeah,
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night,
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you wanna scream
Verse
Kill the lights, shut em off, you're electric
Devil eyes tellin' me "Come and get it",
I'll have you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Girl, tonight you're the prey, I'm the hunter
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me whisperin' in your ear that I wanna
Take off all your clothes and put somethin' on ya
Bridge
And I've tried to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back
Chorus
If you wanna scream yeah,
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night,
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you wanna scream
Out, Louder, scream, louder, louder, louder, louder,
Hey tonight I scream, I'm on need
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
Yeah,
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night,
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you wanna scream
